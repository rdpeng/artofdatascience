# Collaboration

We (Elizabeth and Roger) have been working together for a decade now and the story of how we started working together is perhaps a brief lesson on collaboration in and of itself. The short version is that Elizabeth emailed someone who didn’t have time to help her, so that person emailed someone else who didn’t have time, so that person emailed someone else who didn’t have time, so that person emailed Roger, who as a mere assistant professor had plenty of time! Some people are irked by this process because it feels like you’re someone’s fourth choice. But many good collaborations come about this way and it either works or it doesn’t work, regardless of where on the list you were when you were contacted.


## The Care and Feeding of Your Scientist Collaborator

Once you’ve found yourself a collaborator, either in the scientific, business, or any other domain, what should you do with this person? Here is some advice that we have accumulated over the years. In this section we may refer to things in the scientific or academic context, because that is where we have the most experience, but we believe that the ideas are general and extend to other domains where collaboration is critical.


### A Scientist is Not a Fountain From Which “The Numbers” Flow

Most statisticians and data scientists like to work with data, and some even need it to demonstrate the usefulness of their methods or theories. So there’s a temptation to go “find a scientist” to give you some data. This is starting off on the wrong foot. If you picture your collaborator as a person who hands over the data and then you never talk to that person again, then things will probably not end up so great. 

There are at least two ways in which the experience will be sub-optimal. First, your scientist collaborator may feel miffed that you basically went off and did your own thing, making them less inclined to work with you in the future. Second, the product you end up with (paper, software, algorithm, etc.) might not have the same impact on science as it would have had if you’d worked together more closely. Perhaps most importantly, “the data” have important context and come from somewhere and someone---data do not live in isolation. Your collaborator is in the best position to explain the details of that to you.
  

### Be Patient, Not Patronizing

Statisticians are often annoyed that “So-and-so didn’t even know this” or are frustrated that “They tried to do this with a sample size of 3!” True, there are egregious cases of scientists with a lack of basic statistical knowledge, but *all good collaborations involve some teaching*. Otherwise, why would you collaborate with someone who knows exactly the same things that you know? 

Just like it’s important to take some time to learn the discipline that you are applying your statistical methods to, it’s important to take some time to describe to your collaborator how those statistical methods you’re using really work. Where does the information in the data come from? What aspects are important; what aspects are not important? What do parameter estimates mean in the context of this problem? If you find you can’t actually explain these concepts, or become very impatient when they don’t understand, that may be an indication that there’s a problem with the method itself that may need rethinking. Or maybe you just need a simpler method.


### Go To Where They Are

This is a bit of advice that Roger got when he was just starting out at Johns Hopkins as a lowly assistant professor. The bottom line is that if you understand where the data come from (as in literally, the data come from this organ in this person’s body), then you might not be so flippant about asking for an extra 100 subjects to have a sufficient sample size. The context from which the data originate is always important to understand.

In biomedical science, the data usually come from people. Real people. And the job of collecting that data, the scientist’s job, is usually not easy. So if you have a chance, go see how the data are collected and what needs to be done. Even just going to their office or lab for a meeting rather than having them come to you can be helpful for understanding the environment and context in which they work. 

It can feel nice (and convenient) to have everyone coming to you, but that’s just vanity. Take the time and go to where they are.


### Their Business Is Your Business, So Pitch In

A lot of research (and actually most jobs) involves doing things that are not specifically relevant to your primary goal (such as a published paper in a good journal). But sometimes you do those things to achieve broader goals, like building better relationships and networks of contacts. This may involve, say, doing a sample size calculation once in a while for a new grant that’s going in. That may not be pertinent to your current project, but it’s not that hard to do, and it’ll help your collaborator a lot. 

You’re part of a team here, so everyone has to pitch in. In a restaurant kitchen, even the Chef works the line once in a while. Another way to think of this is as an investment. Particularly in the early stages there’s going to be a lot of ambiguity about what should be done and what is the best way to proceed. Sometimes the ideal solution won’t show itself until much later (the so-called “j-shaped curve” of investment). In the meantime, pitch in and keep things going.


### Your Job Is To Advance The Science

In a good collaboration, everyone should be focused on the same goal. In my area, that goal is improving public health. If I have to prove a theorem or develop a new method to do that, then I will (or at least try). But if I’m collaborating with a biomedical scientist, there has to be an alignment of long-term goals. Otherwise, if the goals are scattered, the science tends to be scattered, and ultimately sub-optimal with respect to impact. If you think of your job in this way (to advance the science), then often you end up with better collaborations. Why? Because you start looking for people who are similarly advancing the science and having an impact, rather than looking for people who have “good data”, whatever that means, for applying your methods.

In the end, I think statisticians and data scientists should focus on two things: Go out and find the best people to work with and then help them advance the science.



## The Care and Feeding of the Data Scientist

Data scientists and statisticians aren’t the only ones out looking for collaborators. Collaboration is a two-way street and there are similarly scientists or business partners out there looking for help with their data. In the current environment, where large complex datasets and sophisticated quantitative and data visualization methods are increasingly common, collaboration with data scientists and statisticians is necessary to harness the full potential of your data and to have the greatest impact. In some cases, not engaging a data scientist collaborator may put you at risk of making statistical missteps that could result in erroneous results and poor decisions.

In the previous section, we discussed how data scientists can build productive relationships with their scientist collaborators. Over time, we have also learned some key lessons regarding how scientists can best cultivate a productive relationship with a statistician or data scientist. The following points are made from the point of view of the scientist or business partner.

### Be Respectful of Time

This tenet, of course, is applicable to all collaborations, but may be a more common stumbling block for scientists working with statisticians. Most power estimates and sample size calculations, for example, are more complex than appreciated by the scientist.  A discussion about the research question, primary outcome, etc. is required and some thought has to go into determining the most appropriate approach before your statistician collaborator has even laid hands on the keyboard and fired up R.  At a minimum, engage your statistician collaborator earlier than you might think necessary, and ideally, solicit their input during the planning stages.  

Engaging a statistician sooner rather than later not only fosters good will, but will also improve your science. A statistician’s time, like yours, is valuable, so respect their time by allocating an appropriate level of salary support on grants or budgets.  Most people appreciate that budgets are tight, so they understand that they may not get the level of salary support that they think is most appropriate.  However, “finding room” in the budget for 1% salary support for a statistician sends the message that the statistician is an afterthought, a necessity for a sample size calculation and a competitive grant application, but in the end, just a formality.   

Instead, dedicate sufficient salary support in your grant to support the level of statistical effort that will be needed.  This sends the message that you would like your statistician collaborator to be an integral part of the team and provides an opportunity for the kind of regular, ongoing interactions that are needed for productive collaborations.
    
### The Statistician is Not a Computational Tool

Although sample size and power calculations are probably the most common service solicited from statisticians (especially in clinical research), and statisticians can be enormously helpful in this arena, they have the most impact when they are engaged in discussions about study designs and analytic approaches for a scientific question. Their quantitative approach to scientific problems provides a fresh perspective that can increase the scientific impact of your work.  My sense is that this is also much more interesting work for a statistician than sample size and power calculations, and engaging them in interesting work goes a long way towards cementing a mutually productive collaboration.

### Learn the Lingo of Statistics

Technical jargon is a serious impediment to successful collaboration. This is true of all cross-discipline collaborations, but may be particularly true in collaborations with statisticians.  The field has a penchant for eponymous methods (Hosmer-Lemeshow, Wald, etc.) and terminology that is entertaining, but not intuitive (jackknife, bootstrapping, lasso).  While I am not suggesting that a scientist needs to enroll in statistics courses (why gain expertise in a field when your collaborator provides this expertise), I am advocating for educating yourself about the basic concepts and terminology of statistics.  

Know what is meant by: distribution of a variable, predictor variable, outcome variable, and variance, for example. There are some terrific “Statistics 101”-type lectures and course materials online that are excellent resources.  But also lean on your statistician collaborators by asking them to explain terminology and teach you these basics. Do not be afraid to ask questions.

### When All Else Fails (and Even When All Else Doesn’t Fail), Draw Pictures

In truth, this is often the place where I start when I first engage a statistician. Showing your statistician collaborator what you expect your data to look like in a figure or conceptual diagram simplifies communication as it avoids use of jargon. Statisticians can readily grasp the key information they need from a figure or diagram to come up with a sample size estimate or analytic approach. 

If you are in a setting where you cannot draw things in person (e.g. working in two different institutions), try your best to draw things out. If you have a tablet-like device, there are numerous apps for drawing figures that can then be sent to collaborators. Video chat software sometimes has a mechanism for sharing a drawing in real time. We have even resorted to drawing things on a piece of paper, taking a picture of the paper, and then texting it to each other. It works!


### Teach Them Your Language

Clinical medicine (the area in which Elizabeth works) is rife with jargon, and just as statistical jargon can make it difficult to communicate clearly with a statistician, so can clinical or domain-area jargon. Avoid technical jargon where possible, and define terminology where it is not possible to avoid it.  Educate your collaborator about the background, context and rationale for your scientific question and encourage questions from them.


### Generously Share Your Data and Ideas

In many organizations, statisticians are very interested in developing new methods, applying more sophisticated methods to an “old” problem, and/or answering their own scientific questions. Do what you can to support these career interests, such as sharing your data and your ideas. Sharing data opens up avenues for increasing the impact of your work, as your statistician collaborator has opportunities to develop quantitative approaches to answering research questions related to your own interests.  

Sharing data alone is not sufficient, though. Discussions about what you see as the important, unanswered questions will help provide the necessary background and context for the statistician to make the most of the available data.  As highlighted in a recent [book](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/31/magazine/is-giving-the-secret-to-getting-ahead.html), giving may be an important and overlooked component of success, and I would argue, also a cornerstone of a successful collaboration.
